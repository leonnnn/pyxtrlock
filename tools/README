make_lock.py
============

PLEASE NOTE: make_lock.py requires python2 as the PIL is not packaged
for python3 on most distris.

Therefore another tool – repickle.py – must be used to postprocess the
generated files.

usage: make_lock.py [-h] [--x-hit X_HIT] [--y-hit Y_HIT] [--fg-color FG_COLOR]
                    [--bg-color BG_COLOR] [--output OUTPUT] [--debug]
                    bg_bitmap [fg_bitmap]

positional arguments:
  bg_bitmap             The single image or the 1-bit mask
  fg_bitmap             If given, the 1-bit foreground pixels

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --x-hit X_HIT, -x X_HIT
                        x-coordinate of the cursor hotspot
  --y-hit Y_HIT, -y Y_HIT
                        x-coordinate of the cursor hotspot
  --fg-color FG_COLOR, -f FG_COLOR
                        The foreground colour (necessary only if the
                        colours cannot be guessed from the image file).
                        Accepted formats:colour name, rgb(255, 50, 0),
                        rgb(1.0, 0.2, 0.0), #ff7700, #f70
  --bg-color BG_COLOR, -b BG_COLOR
                        The background colour.
  --output OUTPUT, -o OUTPUT
                        The output file, by default stdout
  --debug               Check for consistency and printthe bitmaps to the
                        stdout


This tools allows you to easily make cursor files for pyxtrlock from
various image file types (basically: anything with 1-3 discrete colors,
various forms of transparency, that can be opened by python imaging).

The recommended file type is PNG.

There are several modes of operation which are guessed from the
supplied file:

*a single colour image with 2 colours and transparency is compiled to
 the appropriate cursor (transparency may either be an alpha threshold
 or single colour transparency)
*a single image with 1 colour will have its border stroked the colours
 should be given on the commandline
*two (one bit!) bitmaps may be given, on is the mask and the other the
 foreground of the cursor. The colours should be given on the commandline.
*colours may be given on the commandline or the default colours black
 and white apply, colours given on the commandline override colours from
 the file, but note that the assignment will be random in that case

Additionally the cursor hotspot can be given otherwhise it is the
center of the image (this is more or less irrelevant, as the all
cursor events are blocked by pyxtrlock).

Typical usage
-------------

To create a cursor from a PNG with two colors (foreground and
background) and transparent pixels and then install it for your user
do the following:

    $ ./make_lock.py lock.png -o lock.pickle
    $ ./repickle lock.pickle
    $ mkdir ~/.config/pyxtrlock/
    $ cp lock.pickle ~/.config/pyxtrlock

If the tool fails to grok an image file it may help to use ImageMagick
to convert it to PNG:

    $ convert fnord.{ico,bmp,....} fnord.png

Requirements
------------
*Python 2.7
*Python 3 for repickle.py
*python-imaging (PIL)

Bugs
----

Probably some. Not all code paths have been tested. (And all the
tested ones contained bugs ;) ).

BMPs with Alpha, .ico with transparence, and .tif are not correctly
handled by the PIL and therefore are neither handled correctly by this
tool.
